<div class="mnuBBText">Moxytronix was born out of the chaos of creativity and the desire to see imagined inventions transported off the page. At its core, Moxytronix is a closely knit community of friends and family whose individual skills and contributions allowed them to turn an idea into a company. Based out of Las Vegas, Nevada, Moxytronix develops stylish and practical technology solutions with an emphasis on eliminating the daily inconveniences and frustrations that are often taken for granted.</div>
