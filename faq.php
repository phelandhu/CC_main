Q: What is the CordCruncher Cord Management System?
</div>
<br />
<div class="mnuBBText">
<span class="mnuBBTextA">A:</span> If you've ever tried storing your headphones in a gym bag, desk drawer, or pants pocket, you've probably experienced the frustration of picking apart a tangled mess of plastic. Finding a way to neatly manage your cords can be a challenge, and when more than one is in the same container? Forget it!<br />
<br />
That's why we developed the CordCruncher Cord Management System.<br />
<br />
The CordCruncher neatly "crunches" cords into an elastic sleeve, letting you customize cord length while granting the convenience of accessibility.</div>
