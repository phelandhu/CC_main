			Thank you for your interest and support! Here at Moxytronix Inc. (“Moxytronix”) we endeavor to provide the best possible products and services for our customers.

		<div class="mnuBBText">
			If you are dissatisfied with your product, contact CordCruncher Customer Support (“Support”) immediately and ask for a Return Authorization (“RA”). Any product that is returned without an RA issuance will not be accepted for process.<br /><br/>
			In the event the product is returned unused, undamaged, in its original condition, and in the original packaging in accordance with this policy, we will exchange it or offer a refund of the purchase price paid.

			Moxytronix warrants CordCruncher Headphones against electronic, audio, and earbud case defects under the conditions of normal use for a period of 90 days from the date of retail purchase by the original purchaser (“Limited Warranty”). Should a product prove defective in any of the above conditions within the Limited Warranty period, contact CordCruncher Customer Support (“Support”) immediately. <span style="font-weight:bold;">This Limited Warranty is valid only for products sold through <a href="http://www.cordcruncher.com">www.cordcruncher.com</a>. Returns for products sold through an affiliated reseller must be handled through that merchant.</span><br /><br/>
			Support will then either request (a) physical documentation in the case of visible external damage (e.g., photographic evidence) or (b) require the return of the product for an exchange with a new model. If it is determined that a warranty claim is valid, Support will provide a Return Authorization (“RA”). An RA must be included with any returned products. Any product that is returned without an RA issuance will not be accepted for process. A replacement will be shipped within one week of confirmation of the warranty claim, or receipt of the returned product.<br /><br/>
